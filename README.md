Hello everyone! welcome to my repo

This was my first major project which i developed and also implemented my logics to make it robust.

Since it was my first project i don't knew much about the spring security as i am in a learning period but soon i'll implement the authentication and authorization feature for this project.

Comment your suggestions and correction in my code.

Thank You
Manpreet Singh
